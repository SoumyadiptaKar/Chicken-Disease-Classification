# Chicken-Disease-Classification

This repository contains the end-to-end implementation of a deep learning model for the classification of coccidiosis in chicken fecal images. The model, based on the VGG16 architecture, offers accurate detection of this prevalent disease in poultry.

## Overview

Coccidiosis is a common and harmful disease affecting chickens worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective management and prevention of widespread outbreaks. Our project aims to provide farmers with a reliable tool for identifying coccidiosis in its early stages through image analysis.

## Features

- Utilizes the VGG16 deep learning architecture for robust image classification.
- Trained on a comprehensive dataset of chicken fecal images annotated for coccidiosis.
- Achieves high accuracy and reliability in disease detection.
- Deployed on AWS for scalability and accessibility.
